Once downloaded, “adult.data” file provides the labeled training data, while “adult.test” file
provides the labeled test data.

The task is to train and test at least 2 different machine learning models (e.g., Naïve Bayes,
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.), and perform comparative analysis (e.g.,
accuracy, efficiency, simplicity, etc.).
